# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 

### Day 0: June 13, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created simple website to track progress. Forked my second repository and learned how to clone it on my machine. Re-wrote Anki cards for Ruby basics exercises.

**Time Spent**: 7 1/2 hours

**Thoughts:** At first I was frustrated because I felt that I had to go back to review the book/exercises again because I couldn't remember it for pseudo-code. That's important to me because I want to know the fundamentals well enough to not have to look it up constantly.
