# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 

### Day 0: June 13, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created simple website to track progress. Forked my second repository and learned how to clone it on my machine. Re-wrote Anki cards for Ruby basics exercises.

**Time Spent**: 7 1/2 hours

**Thoughts:** At first I was frustrated because I felt that I had to go back to review the book/exercises again because I couldn't remember it for pseudo-code. That's important to me because I want to know the fundamentals well enough to not have to look it up constantly.

### Day 1: June 14, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly finished Ruby Anki cards, just need to finish up hashes. Also leveled up in rank on Codewars!

**Time Spent**: 4 hours, 41 minutes

**Thoughts:** Yay! I leveled up on Codewars! I remember a couple weeks ago I couldn't even understand what to do, how to write the code, or what kata meant. Everyday I'm practicing exercises and it's helping to solidify concepts in my head.
